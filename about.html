			<h1>My life</h1>
			<p>I am Adrian Hipolito Tomas, 21 years of age, born in year 2000, on the 4th of December. I live in San
				Miguel, in the city of Tarlac. I'm an easygoing person who gets excited over little things. I enjoy
				making new friends and bonding with them in my spare time, especially with those with whom I share
				interests. One of my favorite pastimes is trying new foods. I enjoy discovering new restaurants and
				tasting their delightful cuisine. Since I was a kid, my father always cooked for us as he was a former
				chef at a restaurant in Dubai during his youth, the reason why I love varieties of food. Desserts are my
				favorite foods since I have a sweet tooth. I also enjoy using the computer to play games, watch videos,
				and search the internet for my assignments.</p>
			<br>
			<p>When I was in high school, my computer teacher taught us basic HTML coding, which made me enjoy my
				computer class at the time because we got to make our own webpage, even though it was just basic HTML. I
				fell in love with that subject, the reason why I decided to become a Web Developer. During my two years
				of studying information technology, I learnt about various of programming languages such as python,
				java, and creating web pages in HTML and CSS. I love HTML and CSS the most as these are simple to
				understand and entertaining. I managed to learn the different sets of commands like how to change the
				background of my website page, how to input tables, and most probably, how to create my own webpage. I'm
				having a great time doing all these things because I can customize and make it on my own way. These are
				all the things I enjoy about web development, and I'm looking forward to grasp more than that to extend
				my knowledge about web development and to become a successful web developer in the years ahead. </p>
