	        <h1>My life</h1>
            <p>I am Adrian Hipolito Tomas from San Miguel Tarlac City, Tarlac. Eating and trying different kinds of food is the some of the things that I love. I like looking for restaurants and try their delicious food. I have a sweet tooth so my favorite kind of foods are deserts. Since I was a kid, my father always cooked for us because he was a chef at a restaurant in Dubai in his younger days and that is why I love food. I also love using the computer to play games, watch videos, and do some searching for my assignments. When I was in my first year of high school, my computer teacher taught us basic HTML coding. I really enjoyed computer class that time because we get to make our own webpage even though it's just basic HTML. I fell in love with that subject that's why I decided to become a Web Developer. </p>
			<br>
            <p>I am a happy go lucky person and I am easily get excited even with the little things. I love to have a lot of friends and bond with them especially those who I have something in common during my free time. During my 2 years of studying Information Technology, I learned a lot of different programming language like python, java, and developing web page in html and css. I love HTML and CSS the most because it is easier to understand and it is enjoyable. I learned the differrent sets of commands like how to change the background of my webpage, how to insert tables, and most likely, how to create my own webpage. I am having a lot of fun while doing these things because I can modify and make it my own style. These are the things I love about web developing and I'm hoping that I will learn more and have wide knowledge about web developing and also hoping that I will be a successful web developer in the future. </p>
